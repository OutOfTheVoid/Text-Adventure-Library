# TAL: Text Adventure Library
(Pending a better name)

This is a repository for my in-development text adventure library written in HaXe.
It is designed to be modular, and work from configuration files, OR from hard-coded actions. In this code, i am practicing seperation of concerns, keeping up OOP usefulness, and trying to generally create something useful. Please feel free to use it how you wish, although i can't make any gaurentees on how well it's going to work.

Dependencies are openfl and hscript, which can both be installed via haxelib.

Have any questions? email me at liam.tab@gmail.com
